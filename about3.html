Augment reality is a technology that overlays digital information such as images videos and sound into the real world. This is typically achieved through the use of a device such as smartphones and AR glasses that can display the digital content in a way that appears to coexist with the physical environment. AR is commonly used in mobile application, gaming and marketing to create interactive experiences for users. The augment reality  has several important and applicating such as ,it improved learning and training, it also enhanced user experience 
Overall AR has potential revolutionize various industries by providing innovative solution that enhance user experience and improve decision making processes.
<p><center><strong><a href="#">1) THE THREE MAIN COMPONENTS OF AN AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE</a></strong></center></p>
In an AR system architecture, there are three main components: hardware, software, and cloud services.
<p>1. Hardware: This refers to the physical devices used in an AR system, such as headsets, glasses, or handheld devices. These devices are equipped with sensors, cameras, and displays to capture the real world and overlay virtual objects or information onto it.

<p>2. Software: The software component of an AR system includes the applications, algorithms, and programming that enable the creation and manipulation of virtual objects in the real world. This includes computer vision algorithms for object recognition and tracking, rendering engines for displaying virtual objects, and content creation tools for designing and developing AR experiences.
<p>3. Cloud Services: Cloud services play a crucial role in AR systems by providing remote computing power, storage, and data processing capabilities. These services enable complex AR applications to offload resource-intensive tasks to remote servers, allowing for real-time and collaborative AR experiences. Cloud services also facilitate the sharing and distribution of AR content across multiple devices and users.

 Augmented Reality. It is a technology that combines the real world with virtual elements, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their surroundings. AR systems use computer-generated sensory inputs, such as sound, graphics, and GPS data, to overlay digital content onto the real environment in real-time. This technology is commonly used in mobile applications, gaming, and various industries like education, healthcare, and architecture.
<p><center><strong><a href="#">2) FUNCTIONS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING UNIT, PROCESSING UNIT, AND VISUAL UNIT</a></strong></center></p>
<p>1. Infrastructure Tracking Unit: Manages communication with external devices, networks, and services to facilitate data exchange and connectivity.
<p>2. Processing Unit: Processes sensor data, performs computations for tracking and mapping the environment, and generates the augmented content to be displayed.
<p>3. Visual Unit: Renders the augmented content onto the user's display device in a way that seamlessly integrates with the real-worldenvironment.
<p><center><strong><a href="#">3. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIDEO SEE-THROUGH AND OPTICAL SEE-THROUGH VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES</a></strong></center></p> 
<p>1. Video See-Through: it is a type of technology that allows users to see the real world through a live video feed while simultaneously overlaying digital information or virtual content onto their view. This is often achieved using devices such as smartphone, tablets, or specialized glasses with built in cameras.  
<p>2. Optical See-Through: Optical see-through AR uses transparent displays that allow users to see both the real world and computer-generated graphics simultaneously. The digital content is superimposed directly onto the user's view of the real environment without the need for a separate camera feed.
<p><center><strong><a href="#">4) APPLICATIONS OF AR SYSTEMS IN ASSISTANCE</a></strong></p></center>
<p>1. Medical Training and Surgery: AR can be used to provide real-time guidance and information to medical professionals during surgical procedures.
<p>2. EDUCATION; The augmented realty allow the flexibility of education which has improved learning.AR technology utilized through various varieties of mediums such as the smartphone, desktop and mobile devices. When using AR technology in the classroom, teachers can create an authentic learning environment for student with different learning style.
<p>3. Navigation and Wayfinding: AR systems can enhance navigation by providing visual cues, directions, and points of interest overlaid on the user's view of the surroundings.</p>
